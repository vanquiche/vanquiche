### Ciao! 

I'm **Steve**, I love developing applications with beautiful designs and intuitive user experiences!

Some of my work includes "Flip Flashcard," an iOS app designed to assist users in studying and retaining information. Additionally, I have authored and published frontend components for both the React and WordPress ecosystems. In all my projects I strive to prioritize performance, accessibility, responsive design, and user experience.

Currently, I'm diving into the realm of cloud services, particularly **Amazon Web Services**, to explore how to utilize them for enhanced architecture, scalability, and quicker deployments.
